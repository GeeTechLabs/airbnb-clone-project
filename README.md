# Airbnb Clone (Backend â€“ Django)

## Overview
A backend-focused Airbnb clone built with **Django**, aiming to support user registration/login, property listings, bookings, reviews, and payments. This project practices professional backend workflows: clean architecture, robust database design, secure APIs, and CI/CD.

## Project Goals
- Ship a production-ready Django backend.
- Model core domain entities (Users, Properties, Bookings, Reviews, Payments).
- Provide well-documented APIs (GraphQL and/or REST) for the frontend.
- Enforce strong security (auth, permissions, rate limiting).
- Use CI/CD to automate testing and deployment.

## Tech Stack (initial)
- **Django** (Python web framework)
- **PostgreSQL** (relational database)
- **GraphQL** (flexible data query layer; optional REST for utility/endpoints)
- **Docker** (containerized dev/prod environments)
- **GitHub Actions** (CI/CD for tests and deployments)
